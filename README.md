Smap is a replica of Nmap which uses shodan.io's free API for port scanning. It takes same command line arguments as Nmap and produces the same output which makes it a drop-in replacament for Nmap.

## Features
- Scans 200 hosts per second
- Doesn't require any account/api key
- Vulnerability detection
- Supports all nmap's output formats
- Service and version fingerprinting
- Makes no contact to the targets

## Installation
### Binaries
You can download a pre-built binary from [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/Smap/releases) and use it right away.

### Manual
`go install -v github.com/s0md3v/smap/cmd/smap@latest`

### AUR pacakge
Smap is available on AUR as [smap-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/smap-git) (builds from source) and [smap-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/smap-bin) (pre-built binary).

## Usage
Smap takes the same arguments as Nmap but options other than `-p`, `-h`, `-o*`, `-iL` are ignored. If you are unfamiliar with Nmap, here's how to use Smap.

### Specifying targets
```
smap 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.2
```
You can also use a list of targets, seperated by newlines.
```
smap -iL targets.txt
```
**Supported formats**

```
1.1.1.1         // IPv4 address
example.com     // hostname
178.23.56.0/8   // CIDR
```

### Output
Smap supports 6 output formats which can be used with the `-o*` as follows
```
smap example.com -oX output.xml
```
If you want to print the output to terminal, use hyphen (`-`) as filename.

**Supported formats**
```
oX    // nmap's xml format
oG    // nmap's greppable format
oN    // nmap's default format
oA    // output in all 3 formats above at once
oP    // IP:PORT pairs seperated by newlines
oS    // custom smap format
oJ    // json
```

> Note: Since Nmap doesn't scan/display vulnerabilities and tags, that data is not available in nmap's formats. Use `-oS` to view that info.

### Specifying ports
Smap scans these [1237 ports](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/s0md3v/3e953e8e15afebc1879a2245e74fc90f/raw/1e20288e9bef43b60f7306b6f7e23044dabd9b8c/shodan_ports.txt) by default. If you want to display results for certain ports, use the `-p` option.

```
smap -p 21-30,80,443 -iL targets.txt
```

## Considerations
Since Smap simply fetches existent port data from shodan.io, it is super fast but there's more to it. You should use Smap if:

#### You want
- Vulnerability detection
- A super fast port scanner
- Results for most common ports (top 1237)
- No connections to be made to the targets

#### You are okay with
- Not being able to scan IPv6 addresses
- Results being up to 7 days old
- A few false negatives
